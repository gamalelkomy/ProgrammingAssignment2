## The following code is to compute the inverse of a square matrix


## The following function is to make the cache for the matrix and
## the inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The following function is to compute the inverse of the matrix
## if it does not exist in the cache

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
